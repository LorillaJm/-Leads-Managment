## 📝 Q&A Preparation

**Q: What happens if a sales consultant tries to edit another's lead?**
A: They see a permission denied message. Only management can edit all leads.

**Q: How does the search work?**
A: It's a global filter that searches across name, contact, and email fields in real-time.

**Q: Can you export the data?**
A: Not yet, but it's on the roadmap. The architecture supports it easily.

**Q: Is it accessible?**
A: Yes! We use Radix UI primitives which are WCAG compliant, plus semantic HTML and ARIA labels.

**Q: How does it perform with thousands of leads?**
A: TanStack Table handles virtualization, and we use pagination. Plus TanStack Query caches data efficiently.
